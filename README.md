Hospital Buddy ios iPhone application written in Swift for MedHack2025

App tested on iphone 14 and iphone 16 pro. The application allows a hospital patient to record (with permission) conversations with doctors whilst in hospital. The audio file is then pushed to Open AI whisper for audio transcription
and then the text is pushed to GPT4o for summarisation and finally delivered back to the patients phone in neat summary.  

Conversations are stored in the history section with date and time stamps.

Future vevisions, will include: 
  API key stored in .env file. (The API key has been revoked).
  Patient profile.
  Ability to send summarised notes to other medical professionals.
